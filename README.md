# distributed-postgres-POC
To be absurdly reductionist, CockroachDB is just an assimilation of a PostgreSQL wire protocol implementation, a storage layer, a Raft implementation for distributed consensus and Postgres's  grammar definition. Using libraries for these I'll build a distributed Postgres POC  ( https://notes.eatonphil.com/distributed-postgres.html )
